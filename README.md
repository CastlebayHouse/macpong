### Description: Everyone knows about Pong, right? Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. I created a version in Java that would work on both Windows and OSX/Mac computers. I did not use a commercial game engine, but rather coded all of the graphics myself, using only the 2D capabilities of the Java Swing library. To play, first use the download link below. After launching the game, first click on the game window using the mouse to give it focus. Then use the arrow keys to select from the menu options.
### Key technologies: Core Java, 2D Graphics
